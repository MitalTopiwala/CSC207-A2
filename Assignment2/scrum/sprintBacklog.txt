NAME     : Draw Circle
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To click the center of the circle, drag, and release to specify
           a circle to be drawn in the current style.
SO THAT  : I can add circles to my canvas

TYPE     : USER STORY 2 : topiwal3
NAME     : Draw Circle Feedback
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
AS A     : user
I WANT   : As a user is specifying a Circle, during the drag, a 'current'
           circle should be on display. As the user drags, the 'current'
           circle changes in real time so that a circle is drawn with
           centre at users initial circle click, with radius out to
           the current dragged mouse position.
SO THAT  : I can see the circle I am about to build on release of the mouse
           button.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 6 : masroor6
NAME     : Circle drawing is broken
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : The first click should specify the center of the circle, with

           implementation.

           		mode circle
           		draw a circle

           		draw a rectangle
           		draw a rectangle
           		select mode squiggle
           		draw a squiggle
           	results in two thinly outlined circles and a thinly outlined 
           	rectangle as well as two thickly outlined rectangles and a thick squiggle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 10 : arshad33
NAME     : Architecture behind creating shape instances is poor
OWNER    : arshad33	
PRIORITY : high
ESTIMATE : 2 days
ISSUE    : A better architecture for creating shape instances so that it is 
more flexible, and easier to work with can be created using the Strategy Design 
pattern as follows:

Create class/abstract class/interface  ShapeManipulatorStrategy as well 
as subclasses/implementators for each type of Shape. Call these the
concrete ShapeNamipulatorStrategies

The concrete ShapeManipulatorStrategies are responsible for 

1. Creating instances of Shape and putting them on top of 
   the PaintModel command stack.

2. Understanding how mouse events modify the shape at the top of the 
   PaintModel command stack.

3. Calling the PaintPanel repaint at appropriate times.

This strategy can be put in place either by having PaintPanel's mouse 
events forwarded through PaintPanel into the current strategy, or by 
simply switching the PaintPanel's event handlers as appropriate.
