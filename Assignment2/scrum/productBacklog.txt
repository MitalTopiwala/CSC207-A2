           		selects fill style solid
           		mode circle
           		draw a circle
           		draw a circle

           		draw a rectangle
           		select mode squiggle
           		draw a squiggle
           	results in two solid circles and a solid rectangle as well as
           	two outlined rectangles and a squiggle

TYPE     : BUG 7 : arshad33
NAME     : Architecture for drawing shapes can be improved
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : high
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design 
Pattern to draw shapes as follows:

The PaintModel should use the command design pattern. 
That is, each shape knows how to draw itself, so there is a single list of 
DrawingCommands maintained by the PaintModel and used by the PaintPanel.
repaint() simply asks the PaintModel to ask command to execute(g).
The simplest way to make this happen is to make each shape implement the 
DrawingCommand interface which requires execute(g) to be implemented.
Well sort of.

NOTE: The PaintModel does know how to logically draw itself, so does
know about strokes and pen colors etc. Depending on how much you want
to split off the logical from the GUI, it may not have to know how to 
draw on the screen. This is a subtle difference. For example, the
following logically describes a scene, without actually knowing
how to draw it on the screen ...

Color = green
Fill = off
Border = on
BorderWidth = 10
Circle radius 10 at 12,15
Color = red
Fill = on
FillColor = black
Border = on
BorderWidth = 7
Square width 20 at 100,200

If you want to build a more 'logical' PaintModel, you can consider ...

1) Create a mirror hierarchy for Shape, this mirror hirerachy 
has things like DrawableCircle which has a Circle. The DrawableCircle
knows how to draw the instance of Circle it holds. Each Shape will
still need information about its color, and stroke, one way or another.

OR

2) Lookup and apply the Visitor design pattern to the more logical
PaintModel.

TYPE     : BUG 8 : arshad33
NAME     : Architecture for handling shape modifiers can be improved 
OWNER    : arshad33
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : The architecture can be improved if we implement the Command Design 
Pattern to handle changes to the graphics contex such as changing drawing 
color, stroke width etc. You can accomplished this by wrapping the changes
to the graphics context in a DrawingCommand. This way these changes can be
added to the Bug 2.1 DrawingCommand list. That is, these new types of 
DrawingCommands appear on PaintPanel's list right along side 
the Shape type DrawingCommands.

TYPE     : BUG 10 : arshad33
NAME     : Architecture behind creating shape instances is poor
OWNER    : arshad33	
PRIORITY : high
ESTIMATE : 2 days
ISSUE    : A better architecture for creating shape instances so that it is 
more flexible, and easier to work with can be created using the Strategy Design 
pattern as follows:

Create class/abstract class/interface  ShapeManipulatorStrategy as well 
as subclasses/implementators for each type of Shape. Call these the
concrete ShapeNamipulatorStrategies

The concrete ShapeManipulatorStrategies are responsible for 

1. Creating instances of Shape and putting them on top of 
   the PaintModel command stack.

2. Understanding how mouse events modify the shape at the top of the 
   PaintModel command stack.

3. Calling the PaintPanel repaint at appropriate times.

This strategy can be put in place either by having PaintPanel's mouse 
events forwarded through PaintPanel into the current strategy, or by 
simply switching the PaintPanel's event handlers as appropriate.

NAME     : Architecture behind choosing selection mode is poor

PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : Code is not modular and is difficult to expand. Need a better
           architecture behind selecting a drawing mode, and handling
           the drawing events. Consider some design patterns here.
           Refactor ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel to get rid of the

           Squiggle's not drawing properly. Need to re-architect the Model
           so that it is more flexible, and easier to work with.

           here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 9 : topiwal3
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing drawing mode is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
ISSUE    : A better architecture behind selecting a drawing mode can be created 
by implementing the Factory Design Pattern as follows:

The factory design pattern should be used by the paint buttons. 
The factory is responsible for creating different ShapeManipulatorStrategy 
instances (see BUG 2.4). That is, when a button is pressed, the appropriate 
ShapeManipulatorStrategy is created and installed in the PaintPanel. 
Note that you can associate text with a button, even if you 
display an ImageIcon. The string attached to the button causes the right choice 
of object creation.
